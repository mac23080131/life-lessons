## üéØ Next Phase: AI Integration & Content Expansion

### Phase 4: AI Integration (Week 5)

#### 4.1 Update AI Service to Use CKB
- [ ] Modify `apps/api/src/ai/ai.service.ts`
- [ ] Add semantic search for relevant concepts
- [ ] Integrate concept suggestions into analysis
- [ ] Add practice recommendations based on lesson content
- [ ] Generate contextual questions from CKB

#### 4.2 Enhanced Lesson Analysis
```typescript
// New analysis structure
{
  summary: string;
  concepts: Array<{
    id: string;
    title: string;
    relevance: number;
    suggestedPractices: Practice[];
  }>;
  suggestedQuestions: Question[];
  relatedConcepts: Concept[];
}
```

#### 4.3 Implement Semantic Matching
- [ ] Option A: Use pg_trgm for keyword matching (v1)
- [ ] Option B: Implement pgvector with embeddings (v2)
- [ ] Create reranking algorithm (relevance scoring)
- [ ] Filter by domain and tags

---

### Phase 5: Content Expansion (Week 8)

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### View Concepts (Frontend)
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/concepts
2. Browse categories or search
3. Click any concept to view details
4. Explore practices, examples, and questions

### Test Backend API
```bash
# Get all categories
curl http://localhost:3001/concepts/categories

# Search concepts
curl http://localhost:3001/concepts/search?q=growth

# Get concept by ID
curl http://localhost:3001/concepts/{id}
```

### Add More Concepts
```bash
# Run seed script
pnpm ts-node scripts/seed-concepts.ts

# Or use bulk import via API
POST /concepts/bulk-import
```

## üìù Technical Debt & Notes

### Current Limitations
1. **Search**: Using simple ILIKE queries, not semantic
2. **Embeddings**: ConceptEmbedding table exists but not populated
3. **AI Integration**: Concepts exist but not yet used by AI service
4. **Progress UI**: Basic implementation, needs stats dashboard
5. **Admin UI**: No admin interface for managing concepts (API only)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Priority 1**: Integrate CKB into AI analysis flow
2. **Priority 2**: Add 10 more popular concepts for demo
3. **Priority 3**: Create admin dashboard for concept management
4. **Priority 4**: Implement semantic search with pgvector
5. **Priority 5**: Add gamification (badges for learning concepts)

### Performance Optimizations Needed
- Add Redis caching for categories
- Implement lazy loading for concept lists
- Optimize related concepts query
- Add database indexes for search
