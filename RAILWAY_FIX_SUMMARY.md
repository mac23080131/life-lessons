# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Found
Build was failing with Prisma Client errors:
```
TS2305: Module '"@prisma/client"' has no exported member 'PrismaClient'
```

## Root Cause
Railway was trying to build the NestJS app **before** generating Prisma Client. The build process needs Prisma types, but they don't exist until `prisma generate` runs.

## Fix Applied âœ…
Updated `apps/api/package.json` build script:

**Before:**
```json
"build": "nest build"
```

**After:**
```json
"build": "prisma generate && nest build"
```

## What Happens Now
1. âœ… Code pushed to GitHub (commit `dbfec63`)
2. ðŸ”„ Railway will auto-detect the push and start new deployment
3. ðŸ”¨ Build will now:
   - Generate Prisma Client first
   - Then build NestJS app
   - Run migrations on startup (from Dockerfile CMD)

## Still TODO: Fix Redis & Database URLs
After this build succeeds, you still need to:

1. **Fix REDIS_URL** in Railway Variables:
   - Delete current `REDIS_URL`
   - Add as **Reference** â†’ Redis service â†’ `REDIS_URL`

2. **Verify DATABASE_URL** is a reference (not plain text)

3. **Monitor logs** for:
   - âœ… "Applying migration..." (migrations running)
   - âœ… "ðŸš€ Life Lessons API running on..." (no errors)
   - âœ… "Nest application successfully started"

## Timeline
- 23:05 UTC - Build script fixed and pushed
- Next: Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway build
- Then: Fix Redis URL variable
- Finally: Test signup/login

## Expected Success Logs
```
âœ“ Generating Prisma Client...
âœ“ webpack compiled successfully
