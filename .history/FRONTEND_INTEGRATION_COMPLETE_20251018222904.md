# Frontend Integration Complete - Groups & Challenges

## ‚úÖ Ho√†n th√†nh

### 1. API Client Updates (`apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added `challengesApi` export with 6 methods:
  - `getCommunity()` - Get all active community challenges
  - `getMy()` - Get user's joined challenges with progress
  - `join(id)` - Join a challenge
  - `create(data)` - Create custom challenge
  - `getGroup(groupId)` - Get group-specific challenges
  - `delete(id)` - Delete challenge (creator only)

### 2. React Query Hooks (`apps/web/src/lib/hooks/useChallenges.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Created new hooks file with 6 hooks:
  - `useChallenges()` - Query community challenges
  - `useMyChallenges()` - Query user's challenges
  - `useGroupChallenges(groupId)` - Query group challenges
  - `useJoinChallenge()` - Mutation to join
  - `useCreateChallenge()` - Mutation to create
  - `useDeleteChallenge()` - Mutation to delete

### 3. Component Updates (`apps/web/src/components/community/ChallengesList.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Imported hooks from `useChallenges` instead of mock `useCommunity`
- ‚úÖ Updated to use real API response structure:
  - Community challenges: Array of Challenge objects with `_count.participants`
  - My challenges: Array of ChallengeParticipant objects with nested `challenge` and `progress`
- ‚úÖ Fixed difficulty color mapping (EASY/MEDIUM/HARD uppercase)
- ‚úÖ Fixed participants count display using `_count.participants`
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling with toast notifications

## üîç API Verification

### Backend Endpoints (All Tested ‚úÖ)
```bash
# Get community challenges
curl http://localhost:3001/api/challenges/community

# Get my challenges (requires auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3001/api/challenges/my

# Join challenge (requires auth)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3001/api/challenges/:id/join

# Create challenge (requires auth)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","type":"COMMUNITY","scope":"LESSON_COUNT","target":10,"duration":7,"difficulty":"EASY"}' \
  http://localhost:3001/api/challenges
```

### Frontend API Calls
- ‚úÖ `challengesApi.getCommunity()` ‚Üí Returns array of 5 challenges
- ‚úÖ `challengesApi.getMy()` ‚Üí Returns user's participations
- ‚úÖ `challengesApi.join(id)` ‚Üí Joins and refreshes queries
- ‚è≥ `challengesApi.create(data)` ‚Üí Create custom (UI TODO)
- ‚è≥ `challengesApi.getGroup(groupId)` ‚Üí Group challenges (UI TODO)
- ‚è≥ `challengesApi.delete(id)` ‚Üí Delete challenge (UI TODO)

## üêõ Known Issues & Notes

1. **Challenge Progress Update:** Currently manual. Needs backend hook when lesson created.
2. **Group Invite Code:** Generated on group creation, stored in database, working correctly.
3. **Translation Keys:** Using `challenges.difficulty.easy/medium/hard` - all present in en.json and vi.json.
4. **Empty States:** Handled with conditional rendering - no errors when no data.
