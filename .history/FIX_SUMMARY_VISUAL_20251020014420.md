# 🎯 SUMMARY - Emergency Fix Deployed

## What Just Happened

```
❌ PROBLEM: Database empty (only 1 table)
           Migrations not working
           App cannot function

✅ SOLUTION: Switch to prisma db push
           Bypasses migration files
           Creates tables directly from schema
           
⏰ STATUS:  Deployed commit 35a41e6
           Railway rebuilding (5 min ETA)
           Tables will auto-create
```
